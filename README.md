We present a security-enhanced solution to the
discovery and selection of services. This solution integrates a
test-based certification scheme proving the security properties
of services. In particular, we describe two algorithms enabling
clients to select the service that best addresses their security requirements.
We also present a prototype implementation of our
approach and an experimental evaluation of its performances.

The software proposed select the best service using the proposed solution in the following paper:
